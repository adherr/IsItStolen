What it is
==========

A script that connects to a [Twitter Userstream][1] and responds to
all tweets that mention the user it's connected as. This script
queries [BikeIndex.org][2] about the contents of the messages it
receives and responds with a short description of the bike and its
stolen status using the [Twitter REST API][3].
